## Call Assist Application from 2019 RPI Hackathon
The challenge was to create an application what would help the most in case of a nautural disaster
This app was to remove uncertainty from location of callers by directly transmitting location to the 911 center
# The App
The app UI is most similar to the biography of an individual, it contains
- Persons's name
- Persons's age
- Persons's heigh
- Persons's eye color
- Persons's hair color
- Persons's medical restrictions/history
- Persons's picture
- Persons's **precise location**
# The website
The website was made to mimick the view that 911 call center would see when the user called them. On this website, you would see **ALL** of the users personal info for better call response. You would also have a maps view, which would have a direct route from your location (call center) to the persons locatio which would get transmitted through the app.   
# Why would you use this app?
By having this app, whenever you would call 911, all of this information would then be sent to the nearest 911 call center. Since 911 uses cell towers to approximate the location of an individual, hundreds of people have died due to inaccuracies of location. By using the cell phone's GPS which connects to at least 5 satilites, you can get accurate location within a foot
# App functionality
- GUI for inputing and editing all of the above attributes
- Sends a text message to a relative that you can set in the app imiidiately when you call 911
- Sends data to website for realtime updates
